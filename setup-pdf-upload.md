## **üìÑ Medical Records PDF Upload Feature**

### **‚úÖ What's Implemented:**

1. **Patient Side:**
   - ‚úÖ PDF file selection
   - ‚úÖ File validation (PDF only)
   - ‚úÖ Upload to Supabase Storage
   - ‚úÖ Database tracking
   - ‚úÖ File management (view/delete)

2. **Doctor Side:**
   - ‚úÖ View patient medical records
   - ‚úÖ Access PDF files directly
   - ‚úÖ See upload dates and descriptions

### **üîß Setup Required:**

#### **Step 1: Create Supabase Storage Bucket**

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Storage**
2. Click **"Create Bucket"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `medical-records`
   - **Public**: `false` (for security)
   - **File size limit**: `10MB`
4. Click **"Create bucket"**

#### **Step 2: Set Storage Policies**

Run this SQL in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Allow patients to upload their medical records
CREATE POLICY "Patients can upload medical records" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'medical-records' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow patients to view their own records
CREATE POLICY "Patients can view their medical records" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'medical-records' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow doctors to view patient medical records
CREATE POLICY "Doctors can view patient medical records" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'medical-records'
);

-- Allow patients to delete their own records
CREATE POLICY "Patients can delete their medical records" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'medical-records' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

#### **Step 3: Create Medical Records Table**

Run this SQL in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Create medical_records table for PDF uploads
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS medical_records (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id UUID REFERENCES patient_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT DEFAULT 'Medical Record',
    file_size INTEGER,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add medical_record_id to consultations table (optional reference)
ALTER TABLE consultations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS medical_record_id UUID REFERENCES medical_records(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_medical_records_patient_id ON medical_records(patient_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_medical_records_uploaded_at ON medical_records(uploaded_at);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE medical_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for medical_records
CREATE POLICY "Patients can view their own medical records" ON medical_records
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = patient_id);

CREATE POLICY "Patients can insert their own medical records" ON medical_records
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = patient_id);

CREATE POLICY "Patients can delete their own medical records" ON medical_records
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = patient_id);

CREATE POLICY "Doctors can view all medical records" ON medical_records
FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
